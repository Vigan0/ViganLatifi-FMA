                <h1>Bleach</h1>
                <p id="bleach"> Bleach (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original
                    manga series Bleach. It was produced by Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV
                    Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of
                    Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the
                    Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the
                    duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In
                    addition to adapting the manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original
                    self-contained storylines and characters not found in the source material.</p>
