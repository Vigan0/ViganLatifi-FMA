                    Stand-up
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Hart's first stand-up performance took place at The Laff House in his native Philadelphia under the
                    name of Lil Kev, which did not go well. His career suffered a slow start and he was booed
                    offstage several times, once even having a piece of chicken thrown at him. After those initial
                    unsuccessful shows, he began entering comedy competitions throughout Massachusetts, with audience
                    receptions eventually improving. It took time for Hart to develop a unique comedic style. After
                    an early period of attempting to imitate comedians like Chris Tucker, he found his own rhythm by
                    delving into his insecurities and life experiences. He said, "Because of what I do, it has to be an
                    open book. But right now this is a book that is being written."

                    Hart's comedy tours began in 2009 with his act titled I'm a Grown Little Man, followed by Seriously
                    Funny in 2010, Laugh at My Pain in 2011, and Let Me Explain in 2013, the last two of which were also
                    released as features in movie theaters. Hart grossed over $15 million from "Laugh at My Pain",
                    making it one of the year's top-selling comedy tours. Hart also has a game app available through
                    iTunes called "Little Jumpman". His Facebook page, Twitter account, and YouTube channel are all
                    connected to and accessible through this app. Most overseas fans of Hart discovered him on
                    YouTube, as well.

                    On April 9, 2015, Hart embarked on a comedy world tour titled the What Now? Tour at the AT&T Center
                    in San Antonio, which concluded on August 7, 2016, at the Columbus Civic Center in Columbus,
                    Georgia. On July 16, 2015, Universal Pictures announced that Kevin Hart: What Now?, a stand-up
                    comedy film featuring a performance of Hart's What Now? Tour, would be theatrically released in the
                    United States on October 14, 2016. The show was filmed live on August 30, 2015, in front of
                    53,000 people, at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field.

                    film Tropic Thunder because the character is gay, citing his own "insecurities".

                    He played Doug in the film The Five-Year Engagement (2012) and appeared in Think Like a Man which
                    was a box office success. He also appeared in the sequel. He had a cameo as himself in This Is the

                    In 2014, Hart starred as Ben in Ride Along, opposite Ice Cube. The film received generally
                    negative reviews from critics, but was a major box office success. Hart returned in the
                    sequel, Ride Along 2, which was released in 2016.</p>
