                <h2 id="p1">Project 1 - My Favorite Celebrity</h2>
                <p>In this project, I discussed my favorite celebrity, Kevin Hart. I provided an overview of his
                    career,<br>
                    highlighting his journey from stand-up comedy to becoming a successful actor and producer. I also
                    <br>
                    explored the various movies he has starred in, showcasing his versatility and impact in the <br>
                    entertainment industry. Additionally, I included a picture of him and shared interesting facts about
                    <br>
                    his personal and professional life, giving a well-rounded insight into why he is my favorite <br>
                    celebrity.

                <h2 id="p2">Project 2 - Tables</h2>
                <p>In this project, I created three tables, each containing different sets of values. These tables are
                    <br>
                    designed to display the prices of various items, categorizing them based on their type or purpose.
                    <br>
                    Each table presents a distinct set of data, making it easy to compare prices and analyze trends <br>
                    across different products or services.
                </p>

                <h2 id="p3">Project 3 - Log in and Sign up form</h2>
                <p>In this project, I developed a system that includes both login and sign-up functionalities. Users can
                    <br>
                    create an account by signing up with their credentials, and once registered, they can securely log
                    <br>
                    in to access the system. The project ensures data validation, password security, and user <br>
                    authentication to enhance security and provide a smooth user experience.</p>
