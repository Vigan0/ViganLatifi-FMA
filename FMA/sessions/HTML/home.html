                <h2 id="about">About Our Company</h2>
                <p>Samsung Group[1] (Korean: 삼성; Hanja: 三星; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ]; stylised as SΛMSUNG) is a South
                    Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in the Samsung Town office complex in
                    Seoul. The group consists of numerous affiliated businesses,[2] most of which operate under the
                    Samsung brand, and is the largest chaebol (business conglomerate) in South Korea. As of 2024,
                    Samsung has the world's fifth-highest brand value.[3]

                    Founded in 1938 by Lee Byung-chul as a trading company, Samsung diversified into various sectors,
                    including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail, over the next three decades.
                    In the late 1960s, Samsung entered the electronics industry, followed by the construction and
                    shipbuilding sectors in the mid-1970s—areas that would fuel its future growth. After Lee died in
                    1987, Samsung was divided into five business groups: Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group,
                    Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group.

                    Key affiliates of Samsung include Samsung Electronics, the world's largest information technology
                    company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker by 2017 revenues;[4][5] Samsung Heavy Industries,
                    the world's second-largest shipbuilder by 2010 revenues;[6] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T
                    Corporation, ranked 13th and 36th among global construction companies, respectively.[7] Other
                    significant subsidiaries are Samsung Life Insurance, the 14th-largest life insurance company
                    globally,[8] Samsung Everland, operator of Everland Resort (South Korea's oldest theme park),[9] and
                    Cheil Worldwide, the world's 15th-largest advertising agency by 2012 revenues.</p>
